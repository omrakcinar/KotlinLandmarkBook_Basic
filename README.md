# KotlinLandmarkBook_Basic

This is a Landmark Saver app. You can save the photos of wonderful places you have visited before. In this first screenshot, there is an activity to add a new
landmark. You can add as much as you want. I used permission launchers, recycler view, sqlite database for this app.

When you click the add new landmark option in the menu. A new entry screen will be show up. Here you can upload the photo of the landmark you want to save
and enter the name, which city it is in and your personal comments. To upload an image you must allow to access to gallery. Then click save to save it to a 
database and it will show up in the main screen. I use Permissions and SQLite database for this.

You can show an item by clicking on them in the main activity. And there is a delete button below the landmark. You can delete the landmark.
It will be deleted from database and will not show up on the RecyclerView in the main page. Also an alert pop up when you click the delete button.
